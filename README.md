### Hi There ðŸ‘‹

My name is Alex! ðŸ˜„

I am an Experienced Data Professinal with almost 10 years of experience in various industries. I have worked in industries such as distribution, high stakes k-12 standardized testing, and finance and banking. In all sectors I have almost entirely focused on collecting, managing, and leveraging data.

I got my undergrads in Supply Chain Management and Economics from University of Northern Iowa. When I started working clung on to data! I enjoyed working with data so much so that I went back to school and got my master's in Business Analytics from the University of Iowa.

Throughout my professional career I have developed data strategies and roadmaps, architected and implemented ETL processes, and curating data marts for cross-functional business units. I use best practices to developed elegant, automated processes to ensure clean, reliable, and secure data is made accessible to enable informed business decisions.

I like to work in cutting edge technologies âš¡ such as AWS, Snowflake, and DBT. I enjoy coding in Python, R, and SQL. I also have experience working with different visualization tool like PowerBI and Tableau :bar_chart:

Outside of data, I love hanging out with my wife and dog, playing guitar, and biking!
